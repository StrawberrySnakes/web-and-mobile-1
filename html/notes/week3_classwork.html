3 types of style = link external style sheet, internal style sheet, inline -- think of it as layers with inline the outermost 
ignore anything that comes after x(in terms of style): !important 

inline ex:
style stays in the head 
this implys it to the entire body 
colors: rbg(255, 0, 0, 0.5)
the last number means transparency from 0(none) to 1(all)

        serif fonts are fonts with hard ends-- used in print media, textbooks, help your eyes read from one end of the line to the other
        ** please use serif fonts on your final projects 

        sans-serif fonts are softer and git rid of those -- typically better on the web/ on a digital media 

        when size is set to 1em is 16px high 
        when body font size is set to 20px 1em will change to 20px
        1 rem is based on the page and will always be 16px 
        rem is a static variable 
        em = * parent
