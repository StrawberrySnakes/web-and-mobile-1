applys to screen types with (...)
@media scrren and (max-width: 500px) {

}
-- this mean will apply to all screen sizes 800px or less 
when building use inspecter to help -- top left corrnor 2nt from left, when you click it shows what website would look like on mobile devise 
USE THIS on final project 

*** <meta name="viewport" content="width=divice-width, initial-scale: 1"> *** viewport makes it so the size changes and does not zoom

typically use max-width (makes websites thinner and scroll down, people dont like scrolling side to sdie)
ex
@media scrren and (max-width: 500px) {
    insert all css here

}

use landscape and portrait 

can use orientation ex @media screen and (orientation:landscape) {}
-- specific to orientation landscape 

@media screen and (max-width: 800px) and (orientation:landscape) {}
-- for 800 px and under only in landscape 

USE THESE in menues on mobile devices/ text to small to read/buttons too small to touch

--put defult styles at the top than any custimizations at the bottom --
remeber css is processes from top down
